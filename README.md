Dijets is an extremely lightweight yet incredibly powerful protocol that powers its Ternary Chain Ledger System. It requires
a very modest and minimum hardware setup to run a Dijets node.

Although the hardware requirements may change in the future when the network usage increases, we have provided several basic installation scripts for automating the installation and startup of DijetsNodeGo.

### Terraform

This is a very rudimentary terraform construct to provision a Dijets Node.

[DijetsNodeGo](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijetsnodego) is a Golang Node implementation for Dijets network.
